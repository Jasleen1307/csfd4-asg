# CSFD2 Assignment – Calculator Project

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a simple Python-based calculator that performs the following operations:

- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

The user selects an operation and enters two numbers. The program then prints the result.  
It was created as part of the CSFD2 assignment to practice Python basics and Git/GitHub workflows.

## 2. Development Process

### Step 1: Writing the Python Program
- Created unit4.py
- Defined functions: add(), subtract(), multiply(), division()
- Implemented input handling and printed results.

### Step 2: Initializing Git
Inside VS Code terminal:

### Step 3: Configuring Git Identity

### Step 4: Connecting to GitHub

### Step 5: Adding .gitignore
Created .gitignore with:

### Step 6: Adding Screenshots
